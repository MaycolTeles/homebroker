    Base ViewSet class to be used by other ViewSets in the app.

    This ViewSet class must be inherited by all other ViewSets in the app
    that needs the common behavior of filtering the queryset based on the user.

    This class provides a common `get_queryset` method that filters the queryset based on the user.
    If the user is a superuser, the entire queryset is returned.

    Inheriting this class ensures that the queryset is filtered based on the user. If you don't want this behavior,
    inherit from `ModelViewSet` directly.

    Attributes:
    -------------
        * `queryset` : `QuerySet`
            The queryset to be used by the ViewSet.

    Methods:
    ----------
        * `get_queryset`: Method to get the queryset based on the user.
